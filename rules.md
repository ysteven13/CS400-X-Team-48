# X-Team 48 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

Careful Discussion and Individual Ability. We will reassign a job to the next best person if someone 
cannot complete their assigned task.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

Regular Meetings and Discussions, full disclosure.

## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

By asking for help, and being open to discussion. All opinions will be welcome.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

By regularly tracking progress and taking the initiative to help each other out.

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together

Respect all opinions.
